                    <p>I think I love vintage for many reasons. One of the reasons is learning about how style was dictated by what was happening in the world during that time. For instance, I find it fascinating how the war informed the dress of the 1940s. After the war the influence of the 50s e.g. The New Look can be found in bridal wear. I found the most gorgeous vintage wedding dress the other day. It was one of those moments where from far away I could see it was something special. I took the dress home  and after inspecting it I found the label Cahill Beverly Hills stitched inside the dress. The information I found on the designer was interesting and I realized it wasn’t just finding the dress that was fun, but learning more about the 50s. 
                    <br>Happy Dressing!

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to wear a plaid dress.</h2>

                    <p>You finally find the plaid skirt you love. You think about fall, you think about breaking out your cute booties, and wonder about tights on colder days. Still, how do you wear your skirt?  I say get creative. A crop top or t is nice for a casual look. A button up, cardigan, belt and booties is easy but very chic. Go preppy or lady like. Pair it with a leather jacket for a for a cross between lady like and tough girl. Another good tip is to pull out some of the subtler colors and mix and match using that color. 
                    <br>Happy Dressing!</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
